# Counter app for testing with jest and enzyme

## What we have learnt from this app

- Setup a very simple app with Jest and Enzyme
- Used Enzyme's shallow() function to render a component
- Tested that required DOM element were rendered using find()
- Used enzyme's text() method to extract the text of an element
- Used simulate() to interact with click button
